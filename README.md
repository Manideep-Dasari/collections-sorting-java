# 🗂️ Collections & Sorting in Java

## 🎯 Objective
A simple Java console program to manage employees and demonstrate sorting using `Collections.sort()` with `Comparator` by salary (descending) and name (ascending).  

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Employee class with name, age, salary  
- Store employees in an `ArrayList`  
- Sort by salary (desc) and name (asc) using `Comparator`  
- Print sorted employee lists  

---

🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Eclipse
- **Collections**: ArrayList, Comparator, Collections.sort()

## 🖥️ Sample Output
```bash
Original List:
Employee [name=Kanmani, age=21, salary=45000.0]
Employee [name=Rambo, age=25, salary=37000.0]
Employee [name=Kathija, age=23, salary=85000.0]

Sorted by Salary (Desc):
Employee [name=Kathija, age=23, salary=85000.0]
Employee [name=Kanmani, age=21, salary=45000.0]
Employee [name=Rambo, age=25, salary=37000.0]

Sorted by Name (Asc):
Employee [name=Kanmani, age=21, salary=45000.0]
Employee [name=Kathija, age=23, salary=85000.0]
Employee [name=Rambo, age=25, salary=37000.0]
```
